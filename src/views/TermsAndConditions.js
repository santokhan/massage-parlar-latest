                location as inferred from IP address, the amount of time a
                visitor spends on our website, which pages are more frequently
                accessed, how the website is accessed (either directly, a search
                engine, or from a link), what sort of software is used (e.g.
                operating system, browser type, etc.), as well as demographics.
